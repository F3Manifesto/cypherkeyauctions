              <h1>What is CC0 DAO?</h1>
              <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                The Copyright Cartel: 0 (CC:0) DAO is a dedicated Web3 Creative Commons DAO,
                focusing on indie fashion, art, music and other creative derivative markets for
                cultivating well capitalised open source.
                <br />
                <br />
                This DAO exists to accelerate the entire creative world to the long overdue, very
                near future when control over creative works no longer ruins so many lives.
                Ultimately, this is due to the abuses Copyright Cartels and the fake promise that a
                certificate on paper of permission from them will mean any more than pennies for
                original creators.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ultimately, information wants to be free, and web3 allows for new models of
                monetisation when creative people can do whatever the hell that they want with each
                others ideas.
                <br />
                <br />
                Finally backing our ideals with real profit.

              <h1>What are daily CC0 DAO Auctions?</h1>
              <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                A cc0 content auction, every day, forever.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every 24 hours a new cc0 NFT goes to public auction on Ethereum with a reserve and
                can bid on to be owned by you. The cc0 NFTs placed on auction are curated by the DAO
                and represent far more than just their content display. They are also access keys
                into the DA0, representative of your voting weight within governance, curation and
                staking settings.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div className={classes.headerWrapper}>
              <h1>What is the difference between the public and DAO only auction? </h1>
              <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                If an auction reserve is not met for the public auction on Ethereum, this NFT put
                for auction on Polygon Network in a DAO only bid setting. This means that you must
                be a member of the DAO to bid and hold $CC0 token to bid with. $CC0 token is
                distributed to members of the DAO.
                <br />
                <br />
                This dual model exists to establish and reinforce the value of CC0 content,
                particularly at a time when it is not yet wildly understood.

              <h1>Why have a reserve? </h1>
              <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                Unlike the conventional wisdom of the copyright cartel dominated old world, cc0
                doesn’t mean no path to profit. In fact, it’s the exact opposite, but, if you’re
                here you probably know that already. The reserve component of the interval auction
                mechanism functions as a way to distinctly capture and convey a rising minimum value
                of high quality content that has been fully unleashed to drive greater amounts of
                source material, derivatives and hyper scale amplification of meaningful messages
                and stories across the metaverse.
                <br />
                <br />
                The auction reserves are determined through DAO governance.

              <h1>What is $CCO? </h1>
              <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                This is the native token for the DAO and is distributed to members through staking,
                direct contributions and other means.

              <h1>What happens every 15 days? </h1>
              <p className={classes.aboutText}>
                Every 15 days the cc0 NFT on public auction is automatically transferred to the CC0
                DAO treasury to serve as cornerstones of the CC0 DAO vault.

                Yes. And it’s been forked directly from NounsDAO with a few custom tweaks added.
                You’re encouraged and welcomed to do the same before you pass it along.
